# Brain-Tumor-Detection
**Project Type**: Self-Project  
**Duration**: June 2025 – Present  

---

#### Objective  
- Built a CNN-based model to classify brain MRI images into three tumor types for early brain tumor detection  

---

#### Approach  
- Resized MRI images to 128×128 grayscale, normalized pixel values, and applied encoding for multi-class classification  
- Designed a 3-layer CNN architecture using Conv–ReLU–MaxPool blocks with 0.5 dropout to reduce overfitting  
- Trained the model for 15 epochs including early stopping, and visualized training metrics using Matplotlib  

---

#### Impact  
- Achieved 91.74% test accuracy, 94.98% training accuracy, and 92.39% validation accuracy on the model  
- Obtained low test loss of 0.2283, indicating strong generalization and reliability on unseen MRI scans  
- Maintained minimal gap between training loss (0.1331) and validation loss (0.1961), demonstrating low overfitting
